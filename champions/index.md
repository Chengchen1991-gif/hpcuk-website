UK HPC Champions
================

The UK HPC Champions are individuals who can:

* advising users on how to access appropriate computational resources
* provide advice on how to exploit these resources effectively
* providing advice on support mechanisms
* provide information on obtaining training in appropriate HPC technologies
* provide advice on HPC career development skills and engaging in outreach activities

The HPC Champions network arose out of the [ARCHER](Http://www.archer.ac.uk) Champions
activity that was funded as part of the ARCHER Outreach grant by [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk).
