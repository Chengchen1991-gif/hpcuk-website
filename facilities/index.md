UK HPC Facilities
-----------------

These are HPC facilities in the UK that have defined access processes for external users:

[ARCHER](http://www.archer.ac.uk)
: The UK national supercomputing service, ARCHER, offers a capability resource for running
very large parallel jobs. Based around a 118,080 core Cray XC system, the service includes
a helpdesk staffed by HPC experts from EPCC with support from Cray Inc. Access is free at
point of use for academic researchers working in the EPSRC and NERC domains. Users can also purchase 
access at a variety of rates. Industry access is available.

[Cirrus](http://www.cirrus.ac.uk)
: Cirrus at EPCC is one of the EPSRC Tier-2 HPC facilities. The main resource is a 10,080
core SGI/HPE ICE XA system. Free access is available to academic researchers working in the EPSRC
domain and from some UK universities; academic users from other domains and institutions
can purchase access. Industry access is available.

[DiRAC](http://www.dirac.ac.uk)
: DiRAC is the STFC HPC facility for particle physics and astronomy researchers. It is
currently made up of five different systems with different architectures. These range from
an extreme scaling IBM BG/Q system, a large SGI/HPE UV SMP system, and a number of
Intel Xeon multicore HPC systems. Free access is available to academic researchs working
in the STFC domain; academic researchers from other domains can purchase access. Industry
access is also available.


Worldwide HPC Facilites
-----------------------

Some facilities around the world may also be accessible to UK users. The
list below includes facilities or organisations that can provide access 
to users from the UK.

[PRACE](http://www.prace-ri.eu)
: PRACE is the pan-European HPC infrastructure through wich UK users can get access to
some of the largest HPC systems in Europe. 

[DOE INCITE](http://www.doeleadershipcomputing.org/incite-program/)
: The US Department of Energy makes access to its Leadership Computing facilities
available to users worldwide through the INCITE programme.
