About HPC-UK
============

We bring together different organisations involved in HPC in the UK
to provide information to users of HPC facilities.

HPC-UK provides information for users and providers on UK HPC facilities.
This includes information on facilities available, how to gain access, what
training courses are available and links to other useful resources. We are
made up of a variety of organisations in the UK including:

[EPCC](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk)
: EPCC at The University of Edinburgh is one of the leading HPC centres
in Europe with over 80 staff who are experts in a wide range of 
advanced computing. EPCC hosts a range of HPC and data facilties at
its Advanced Computing Facility.

[UK Research Software Engineers Association](http://www.rse.ac.uk)
:  UK research relies on RSEs, so a campaign started by RSEs and the
Software Sustainability Institute founded the UK RSE Association to bring
together RSEs to share knowledge, provide support and help campaign for
recognition in academia.
