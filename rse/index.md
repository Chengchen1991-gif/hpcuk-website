# Who are Research Software Engineers?

[Research Software Engineers](http://www.rse.ac.uk) are people who combine expertise in programming
with an intricate understanding of research. RSEs are an invaluable source of expertise that can
help researchers in understanding how HPC can help their research and in providing support to get 
the most value out of HPC.

## Peer support for RSEs

This site hosts information on the UK HPC RSE Network that provides a forum for RSEs involved in 
supporting researchers using HPC to discuss topics of interest and share experience and expertise.
