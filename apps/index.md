HPC Applications
================

All users on HPC systems rely on HPC applications for modelling and 
simulation. Getting the best out of the applications you are using is 
critical to advancing your research and maximising the value of the 
HPC resources you have access to.

This page brings together information on:

* Compiling performance versions of popular HPC applications
* Benchmarks and performance data for HPC applications

Compiling HPC Applications
--------------------------

Information on compiling HPC applications is usually available as
part of the standard application documentation. However, many 
HPC applications are complex and the specific instructions for 
different HPC platforms can differ from the standard instructions.

A number of resources are available with compile instructions for 
specific UK HPC facilities:

[Compiling HPC Applications on ARCHER]
: The ARCHER CSE service provides instructions for compiling many 
packages on the ARCHER UK National Supercomputing service, a Cray
XC30 system.
