HPC Applications
================

All users on HPC systems rely on HPC applications for modelling and 
simulation. Getting the best out of the applications you are using is 
critical to advancing your research and maximising the value of the 
HPC resources you have access to.

This page brings together information on:

* Compiling performance versions of popular HPC applications
* Benchmarks and performance data for HPC applications

Compiling HPC Applications
--------------------------

Information on compiling HPC applications is usually available as
part of the standard application documentation. However, many 
HPC applications are complex and the specific instructions for 
different HPC platforms can differ from the standard instructions.

A number of resources are available with compile instructions for 
specific UK HPC facilities:

[Compiling HPC Applications on ARCHER](http://www.archer.ac.uk/documentation/software/)
: The ARCHER CSE service at EPCC provides instructions for compiling many 
applications on the ARCHER UK National Supercomputing service, a Cray
XC30 system running CLE 5 with the Cray, Intel and GCC compilers;
and Cray MPI.

[Compiling HPC Applications on Cirrus](https://github.com/EPCCed/cirrus-packages)
: The Cirrus service at EPCC provides compilation instructions for compiling
many applications on the Cirrus Tier-2 HPC service, a HPE/SGI ICE
XA system running CentOS 7 with the Intel and GCC compilers; and
SGI MPI and Intel MPI.

[Compiling HPC Applications on Thomas](https://github.com/UCL-RITS/rcps-buildscripts)
: UCL provides compilation scripts for compiling
many applications on the Thomas Tier-2 HPC service, a Lenovo
HPC cluster running Linux with the Intel and GCC compilers; and
Intel MPI and OpenMPI.

Benchmarks and Performance Data
-------------------------------

The following links provide more information on benchmarks and performance
data on UK HPC systems.

[ARCHER Benchamrks](http://www.archer.ac.uk/community/benchmarks/archer/)
: The ARCHER CSE service at EPCC have compiled a small number of large 
benchmarks to test scaling and performance for real-world scientific 
problems. Both the benchmarks and latest performance results are 
available along with a white paper describing how the benchamrks were
selected.

[ARCHER KNL Performance Comparison](http://www.archer.ac.uk/community/benchmarks/archer-knl/)
: The ARCHER CSE service at EPCC have compared the performance of 
Cray compute nodes based on the KNL Intel Xeon Phi manycore processor
to standard ARCHER compute nodes based on the Ivy Bridge Intel Xeon
CPU. There are results and reports for a range of different HPC
applications.
