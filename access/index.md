Academic Access
===============

UK academic researchers can usually apply for access within a grant application. Some 
facilities also offer different methods of access that do not require applicants
to prepare full grant applications.

Simple Access Methods
---------------------

Instant Access or Seedcorn access is usually a lightweight process to get a small amount
of resource to assess the suitability of a facility for the proposed researc. It is also
often used to gather benchmarking data to support an application for larger-scale 
resources.

The following facilities support Instant or Seedcorn Access:

[ARCHER Instant Access](http://www.archer.ac.uk/access/instant-access)
: Academic researchers whose work falls into the [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk) remit
can apply for up to 1200 kAU for 6 months as part of an ARCHER Instant Access 
application.

[Cirrus Instant Access](http://www.cirrus.ac.uk/access/instant)
: Similarly, academic researchers whose work falls into the [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk) remit
can apply for up to 7000 CPUh for 6 months as part of a Cirrus Instant Access 
application.

Other methods that give access to small amounts of resource for testing/evaluation
purposes:

[ARCHER Driving Test](http://www.archer.ac.uk/training/online/driving_test.php)
: UK academic researchers can gain free access to 1200 kAU for up to 6 months on completion
of the online ARCHER Driving Test.

Grant Access
------------

Most UK HPC facilities have mechanisms for requesting resources as part of grant 
applications. The precise method usually varies with facility and funding body. The
links below take you to the relevent sections of facility websites that describe the
process for getting access through grant applications.

[ARCHER Access](http://www.archer.ac.uk/access)
: ARCHER has specific processes for researchers applying for access through grants from
EPSRC and NERC. There is also advice for how to proceed if requesting access through
other academic funding bodies.

[Cirrus Access](http://www.cirrus.ac.uk/access)
: Cirrus has specific processes for researchers applying for access through grants from
EPSRC. There is also advice for how to proceed if requesting access through
other academic funding bodies.

Other Access Methods
--------------------

A number of facilities have alternative access methods available for large amounts of resource.


[ARCHER RAP](http://www.archer.ac.uk/access/rap)
: Academic researchers whose work falls into the [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk) remit
can apply for large amounts of ARCHER resource for up to 12 months via the ARCHER
Resource Allocation Panel (RAP). Calls are usually opened three times a year.

[DiRAC RAC](http://dirac.ac.uk/access.html)
: Academic researchers whose work falls into the [STFC](http://www.stfc.ac.uk) remit
can apply for access to DiRAC facilities as short or long projects through the 
DiRAC Resource Allocation Committee (RAC). Calls are usually opened twice a year.
