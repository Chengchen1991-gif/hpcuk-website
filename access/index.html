summary: Get access to HPC facilities

<h2>Academic Access</h2>

<p>
UK academic researchers can usually apply for access within a grant application. Some 
facilities also offer different methods of access that do not require applicants
to prepare full grant applications.
</p>

<p>
Many facilities have restrictions on remit for free access depending on which research
council has funded the facility. For example, EPSRC and NERC remit can gain free access
to ARCHER; STFC remit can gain free access to DiRAC; and EPSRC remit can also gain free
access to the various national Tier-2 HPC facilities.

<h3 id="simple">Simple Access Methods</h3>

<p>
Instant Access or Seedcorn access is usually a lightweight process to get a small amount
of resource to assess the suitability of a facility for the proposed research. It is also
often used to gather benchmarking data to support an application for larger-scale 
resources.
